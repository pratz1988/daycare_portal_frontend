# Day Care Portal App (frontend)
This app is built to facilitate parent teacher interaction in a day care setup, where parents will be able to view what children activities are and teachers will be able to post new activity and also interact with the parents as needed. This is the back end for this app.

# How it works

The app can be used from two points of view

1)	Parent – From a parent POV, you can use the app to view the activities for your children for the current week. Parents also have the options to post special notes related to their children for the teacher’s attention. Please login using number from 1-10 as both username and password. 
2)	Teacher – From a teacher’s POV, the app can be used to enter children activity like breakfast, play, nap time etc. Teachers also have the ability to view special notes from parents. Please login using number 1 as both username and password.

# Tech behind this

The frontend for the app is built using React.js, JavaScript, HTML/CSS. I have used the CSS framework Semantic UI. This framework was particularly useful for designing the menu bar, panels and other UI components. Using this, I learned how to build single page applications using React.js by breaking everything down into components.
