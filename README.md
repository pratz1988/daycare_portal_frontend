# Day Care Portal App 

I built the Full stack application as part of my GA ( General Assembly ) SEI bootcamp. This app is built to faciliate parent teacher inteaction in a day care setup, where parents will be abel to view what children have been doing and teachers will be able to post the activity and also inteact with the parents as needed. This is the front end for this app.

# How it works

The portal has two interaction poitns 

1) Teacher - When a teacher logs in, they will be able to look at all the children in their calss and they will have the ability to add activity for children ( activity like breakfast, lunch, nap time , etc. ). They will also get a view into all the notes left by parents.

2) Parent - When a parent logs in, they will have the ability to look at what their clildren activity is for the given week. They will also have the option to leave a note to the teacher.

# Tech behind this

The app is built in React.JS, HTML and CSS. I have used the Sematic UI CSS framework for some of the look and feel (https://semantic-ui.com/).
